It includes various attributes about Netflix's content, such as `title`, `director`, `country`, `rating`, `duration`, and more.

## Project Overview

The project aims to answer 30 different business questions about Netflix content through SQL queries. These queries cover various aspects, including:

- **Content type distribution**: Understanding the balance of Movies vs. TV Shows
- **Director and actor analysis**: Finding the most frequent collaborators
- **Genre and rating insights**: Analyzing popular genres and ratings
- **Time-based analysis**: Content added over time and seasonal trends

Each query provides insights that are crucial for business intelligence and content strategy on streaming platforms like Netflix.
